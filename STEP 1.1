1) Find Character Case

Problem statement
Write a program that takes a character as input and prints 1, 0, or -1 according to the following rules.
1, if the character is an uppercase alphabet (A - Z).
0, if the character is a lowercase alphabet (a - z).
-1, if the character is not an alphabet.

solution 
#include<iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
	char ch;
	cin>>ch;

	if(ch>=65 && ch<=90){
		cout<<"1"<<endl;
	}
	else if(ch>=97 && ch<=122){
		cout<<"0"<<endl;
	}
	else{
		cout<<"-1"<<endl;
	}
	
}


here , i have not used the return statament as in case of -1 , it gives abnormal hemographic TLE. 


2) Data Type

Problem statement
Data type refers to the type of value a variable has and the way the computer interprets it.



Each data type has a different size. You’ve studied 5 different data types and the sizes of the data types:

Integer: 4 bytes
Long: 8 bytes
Float: 4 bytes
Double: 8 bytes
Character: 1 byte


You’re given a data type. Print its size in bytes.

solution 

int dataTypes(string type) {
	if(type=="Integer"){
		return 4;
	}
	else if(type=="Long"){
		return 8;
	}
	else if(type=="Float"){
		return 4;
	}
	else if(type=="Double"){
		return 8;
	}
	else if(type=="Character"){
		return 1;
	}
}


3)   if-else (Decision Making)

Problem statement
Programming languages have some conditional / decision-making statements that execute when some specific condition is fulfilled.



If-else is one of the ways to implement them.



You are given two numbers 'a' and 'b'.



Compare the numbers and print the relation.



Print “smaller”, “greater” or “equal” when ‘a’ is smaller than ‘b’, greater than ‘b’, or equal to ‘b’ respectively.

solution 

string compareIfElse(int a, int b) {
	if(a<b){
		return "smaller";
	}
	else if (a>b){
		return "greater";
	}
	else if (a==b){
		return "equal";
	}
}
